# PortableServo

In order to recreate this project, you will need the materials included in the [material list](https://github.com/pschake34/PortableServo/blob/master/docs/MaterialList "MaterialList"), the [code](https://github.com/pschake34/PortableServo/blob/master/Motor_mannnn_portable.ino "Code"), [the CAD files](https://github.com/pschake34/PortableServo/tree/master/solidworks "CAD Files"), and the following instructions.

## Instructions

1. Cut out the sides of the servo and arduino enclosure with a laser cutter.
2. Screw the arduino (equipped with an arduino shield to the base of the enclosure.
3. Assemble the wiring

4. (Only required if you wish to have an authentic reproduction) Roast the acrylic peices with a heat gun and superglue the acrylic peices together
5. The CAD files for simply bending acrylic are not included, but with some work you could create them and create a slightly non-authentic model
6. Screw in the buttons on the top, the servo, and the battery holder.
7. Screw/ glue down the top.
8. Completion

## Conclusion

We experimented quite a bit with this project, and didn't get very great results (Melting Acrylic). I think that this project was a very good
learning experience and satisfied some desire for melting acrylic that resided in Ben. If we had thought through our backup plan a little bit
better, we likely wouldn't have been so far set back that Mr. Helmstetter let us superglue our roasted peices of acrylic together.
