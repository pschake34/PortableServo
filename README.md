# PortableServo

In order to recreate this project, you will need the materials included in the material list, the code, the cad files, and the following instructions.

# Instructions

First of all, you will need to cut out the sides of the servo and arduino enclosure with a laser cutter. If you want to be authentic,
you will need to roast the acrylic peices with a heat gun, but you don't have to. What we did was superglue the acrylic peices together, 
but with some work you could change the cad files so that you can bend the acrylic instead. Before you finish putting the top on the 
arduino enclosure, you will want to assemble the wiring for the arduino and screw in the buttons, servo and battery holder. After putting on
the top, you are done!
